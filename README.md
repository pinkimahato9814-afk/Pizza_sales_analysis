The Pizza Sales Analysis project is designed to analyse transactional sales data from a pizza store. The goal is to identify key business insights, trends, and KPIs that will help management make informed decisions related to sales, marketing, and operations. 
 
Business Objectives 
Identify overall revenue,total pizzas sold, and total number of orders. 
Determine sales distribution by pizza category, size, and type. 
Analyse time-based trends in sales (daily, monthly, and yearly). 
Highlight best-selling and least-selling pizzas by revenue and quantity. 
Understand customer purchasing behaviour through Average Order Value (AOV) and Average Pizza per Order. 
Provide visualization dashboards for effective decision-making. 
 
Data Source & Description 
Dataset: pizza_sales.csv 
Key fields: 

order_id → Unique identifier for each order 

pizza_id → Unique identifier for each pizza 

pizza_name → Name of the pizza sold 

quantity → Number of pizzas sold per order 

total_price → Total revenue for each transaction 

date, time → Order timestamp for time-based analysis 

pizza_category, pizza_size → Attributes for pizza classification 



Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

Total Revenue = Sum of total_price 

Total Pizzas Sold = Sum of quantity 

Total Orders = Count of unique order_id 

Average Order Value (AOV) = Total Revenue ÷ Total Orders 

Average Pizza per Order = Total Pizzas Sold ÷ Total Orders
